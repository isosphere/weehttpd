weehttpd HTTP Server

A very basic HTTP server. 

Objectives:
- Fast
- Fault-tolorant
- Secure
- Code that is easy to understand and modify

Compromises:
- All files are cached to memory on startup only, no files are served directly from the file system
- Designed to serve small static websites
- Very minimal HTTP 1.1 compliance, probably not standards-compliant
