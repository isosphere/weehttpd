weehttpd HTTP Server

A very basic HTTP server. 

Objectives:
- Fast
- Fault-tolorant
- Secure
- Code that is easy to understand and modify

Compromises:
- Pages are cached on startup only, no files are served directly
- Designed to serve small amounts of HTML. 
- Very minimal HTTP 1.1 compliance 

I'm not sure how I want to handle images yet. I think I would like 
to cache all required images on startup and never touch the filesystem again.
